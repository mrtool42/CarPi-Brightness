# CarPi-Brightness

A little Python script for my Car-Pi to control the brightness of the LCD screen with PWM over GPIO when its powered on.
To determine if it's day or night in my location, the python package "Astral" is used.
When booting up, the screen is dimmed if the sun is below the horizon, and bright if the sun is above a few degrees.

Feel free to edit and use for your own needs ;)
