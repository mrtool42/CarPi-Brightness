# raspi-brightness

A little Python script for my Raspberry Pi to control the brightness of a LCD screen with PWM over GPIO when its powered on.
To determine if it's day or night in my location, the python package "Astral" is used.
The screen is dimmed when the sun is below the horizon and bright when the sun is above a few degrees.

Feel free to edit and use for your own needs ;)
